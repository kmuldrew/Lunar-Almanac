# Lunar-Almanac
Nautical almanac pages similar in style to those ca. 1800

The program creates a pdf file for a particular month giving the lunar distances that are convenient for each day of the month as well as a few other useful tables for working lunars as a navigator might have done around the year 1800. Time is Greenwich apparent time and the day starts at noon.
